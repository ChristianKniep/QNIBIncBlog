# ISC 2016 Workshop

This years 'Linux Container' workshop at the ISC 2016 is called: <br>
 **Docker: Linux Containers to Optimise IT Infrastructure for HPC & BigData**.

Unlike last year the focus is to provide actionable knowledge about the world of Linux Containers, discuss problems and possible solutions.
The initial agenda will be pushed out as soon as possible. Please revisit this side in a couple of days.

For an idea of what the workshop is going to touch on the following video recording of the hosts' talk in Lugano provides some guidance:

The issues are talked about from [0:22:30](https://youtu.be/3gTJj-HuZuo?list=PLfE3_wJGw9KS3PBvqEcDdpiODeDjAs5v8&t=1350) on.

## Agenda

#### What drives docker in Non-HPC and how to catch up?

</div>
Docker benefits the non-HPC environments with its boost to software development by providing fast feedback loops and an easy setup of development environment.<br>
This part will dive into why that is and shed some light on why HPC environments haven't benefited yet.

#### Singularity - best of Containers and clean packaging?

#### Ubercloud - Tackle the ISV
<div id="portrait">

</div>
UberCloud has developed software containers to host ISV codes for on-premise and in the HPC Cloud environments. These production ready containers bundle OS, libraries and software tools as well as ISV software and even whole engineering and scientific workflows. By eliminating the need to install software and configure the high performance computing environment, the time for packaging and accessing ISV software in the cloud has been reduced dramatically.

#### Docker Volumes w/ BeeGFS

#### RDMA Namespace & CGroups for InfiniBand
