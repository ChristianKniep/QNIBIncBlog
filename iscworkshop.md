### ISC 2016 Workshop

This years 'Linux Container' workshop at the ISC 2016 is called: <br>
 **Docker: Linux Containers to Optimise IT Infrastructure for HPC & BigData**.

Unlike last year the focus is to provide actionable knowledge about the world of Linux Containers, discuss problems and possible solutions.
The initial agenda will be pushed out as soon as possible. Please revisit this side in a couple of days.

For an idea of what the workshop is going to touch on the following video recording of the hosts' talk in Lugano provides some guidance:
