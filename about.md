### ... QNIB Solutions

QNIB Solutions (early on called 'QNIB Inc') derives from the first project Christian did during his B.Sc. report, a InfiniBand monitoring suite.
For the sake of the report is was named 'OpenIBPM: Open Source InfiniBand Performance Monitoring'. Afterwards
Christian renamed it to match his last name (Kniep): 'QNIB: Qualified Networking with InfiniBand'.
Since then QNIB becomes a pet project's theme...

Christian passion is to improve the ease of use of those stubborn machines we call IT equipment.

He started at the dawn of the Euro (2002) as an generic System Administrator, installing desktop
and server systems running MacOS (9/X), Windows and Linux.
Since then Christian iterated through support positions, mostly in an automotive R&D context.
He maintained end user applications, virtual reality systems (functional/esthetic),
in-house infrastructure and shifted towards HPC cluster environments.
At the latest non-R&D position Christian was in charge of an InfiniBand network with a couple of thousand nodes.

In 2013 he moved to Paris to work as an R&D Engineer in the HPC section of Bull SAS. His job (and passion) was
to help shaping a Log and Performance Mangement solution that will withstand the node increasement introduced by the next generation of
supercomputers. At the end of 2014 Christian moved back to Germany to persue his passions in a more unconstrained fashion.
After working for a local-commerce StartUp he switched to Playstation Now in mid-2015 to help containerize their stacks. After two years Christian changed to work as a TAM for Docker Inc, until a recent shift to AWS to push the use of Cloud Services as a 'Senior Specialist Soulution Architect for EC2 Spot'.
