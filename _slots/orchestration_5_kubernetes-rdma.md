title: Using K8s operators for containerized RDMA workloads
start: "14:23"
description: "RDMA is well-known high-performance networking interface for low latency, low overhead communications. RDMA accelerated Kubernetes clusters are set using standard device plugin and CNI interface for InfiniBand or Ethernet. Compute nodes join Kubernetes cluster dynamically. It is desired to advance the user experience for automated configuration and deployment. In this talk we will discuss how Kubernetes operators help to automate, deploy and upgrade infrastructure software components for faster node availability."
