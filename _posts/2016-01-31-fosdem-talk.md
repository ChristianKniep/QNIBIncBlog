## eGalea Conference

As I said at the end of the talk a conference/workshop is in the pipeline to provide the attendees with the steps and knowledge to spin up the presented stack on-top of your own metal - or on your laptop. It's not completely written into stone yet, but the planned date is April 20th & 21st in Pisa.

It's going to be a mix of talks and hands-on sessions to get everyone acquainted with the bits and pieces needed and how to compose it.

Please feel free to reach out if you like to attend, so that we get early feedback to plan the sessions out.
