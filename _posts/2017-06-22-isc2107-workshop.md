**Christian Kniep** With a 10y journey rooted in the HPC parts of the german automotive industry, Christian started to support CAE applications and VR installations.<br>
After getting bored with the small pieces, he became the InfiniBand go-to-guy while operating a 4000 node crash-test cluster and pivoted to the R&D department of Bulls BXI interconnect. When told at a conference that HPC can not learn anything from the emerging Cloud and BigData companies, he became curious and is now leading the containerization effort at Gaikai Inc. (part of Sony Interactive Entertainment).<br>
Christian likes to explore new emerging trends by containerizing them first and seek application in the nebulous world of DevOps.

**Holger Gantikow** studied Computer Science at the University of Furtwangen and is working as a Senior Systems Engineer for Science + Computing AG in TÃ¼bingen since 2009. In his work, he deals with the complexity of heterogenous systems in CAE computation environments and servers customers utilizing technical and scientific applications. Ever since he started his professional career, virtualization and how it changes IT infrastructures gained his interest. This includes especially cloud management systems like OpenNebula and OpenStack, as well as the recently rediscovered container-based virtualization technology based on Docker.

**Michael Bauer** is an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, where he is studying Computer Science & Engineering with a focus on computer architecture. He has spent the last 9 months working at the GSI national laboratory in Darmstadt, Germany, as an experimental systems researcher. For the last several months, he has been a developer of Singularity, an open source container solution designed for HPC.

**Paolo Di Tommaso** is research software engineer at Center for Genomic Regulation, Spain. He is a 20 years experienced software developer, software architecture designer and advocate of open source software. His main interests are parallel programming, HPC and cloud computing. Paolo is B.Sc. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Bioinformatics. He is the creator and project leader of the Nextflow workflow framework

**Luk Burchard** is a Software Engineer at Loodse working on the Kubermatic Container Engine, a Kubernetes automation system. Besides that, he studies Computer Science at TU-Berlin, is a Kubernetes contributor and is passionate about cluster management technologies.

**Wolfgang Gentzsch** is co-founder & president of the UberCloud Community and Marketplace for engineers and scientists to discover, try, and buy computing power on demand in the cloud. He is also Co-Chairman of the ISC Cloud & Big Data conference series. Wolfgang was Director At-Large of the Board of Directors of the Open Grid Forum, and an advisor to the EU projects DEISA and EUDAT. Before he directed the German D-Grid Initiative, was a professor of computer science at Duke in Durham, NC State in Raleigh, and the University of Applied Sciences in Regensburg, and a visiting scientist at RENCI, the Renaissance Computing Institute at UNC Chapel Hill. Wolfgang was a member of the US President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, PCAST, and held leading positions at Sun, MCNC, Gridware, and Genias Software.
