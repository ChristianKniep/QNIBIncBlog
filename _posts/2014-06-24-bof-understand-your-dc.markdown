At ISC14 Christian gave a Birds-of-the-Feather talk about the benefits provided by overlaying multiple information layers
within the HPC cluster stack. The topic debuted at OSDC14 (post with video [here](/talk/2014/04/10/understand-your-datacenter/)).
Furthermore Christian had an video-taped interview with Rich Brueckner from insideHPC, which is available [here](/qnibterminal/2014/06/25/interview-insideHPC/).
