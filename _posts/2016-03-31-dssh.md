Whoo, long time no see (read: blog-post)... :)

But don't you worry guys, I have a nice one this time, I promise. 

Even though - <b>CAUTION!</b> - if you have kids in the room, which honour security by not messing around with `ssh`, be advised that it might be hard... 

## Recap Swiss Workshop of the HPC Advisory Council

I went to Lugano again to talk about Docker in HPC, as always it was a breeze.
Nice talks about D-Wave, FPGA, GPU, Deep Learning and on it goes. 

I talked about Linux Containers with an emphasis on the issues we face and how they might be overcome.

At [0:22:30](https://youtu.be/3gTJj-HuZuo?list=PLfE3_wJGw9KS3PBvqEcDdpiODeDjAs5v8&t=1350) I start talking about the issues, if you want to flip forward.

## sshd-less OpenMPI?

As I pointed out, in my opinion the power of docker today is empowering the developers/end-users/scientist to iterate faster on their task. For developers that is easy, as they have a simple setup.

For HPC users or scientist it's harder because they need a distributed system. As long as they can work on one box it's as easy as developing code.

But once they want to cross over to a multi-host setup they need `sshd` to login to the remote node and `slurmd` to register the node in SLURM. One could setup both on the bare-metal host and try fishy things, but it's not getting simpler.


### Proof of Concept

OK, let's see....

I can run the hello world on a remote host with two tasks.

{% highlight bash %}
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$ mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 2 --host 2ec09afc006e /scratch/hello_mpi
Warning: Permanently added '2ec09afc006e,172.17.0.4' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Process 0 on 2ec09afc006e out of 2
Process 1 on 2ec09afc006e out of 2
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$
{% endhighlight %}

By stoping the `sshd` I am blocked...

{% highlight bash %}
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$ mpirun --allow-run-as-root -n 2 --host 2ec09afc006e /scratch/hello_mpi
ssh: connect to host 2ec09afc006e port 22: Connection refused
{% endhighlight %}

But how about I use a different command to start the process?

{% highlight bash %}
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$ cat /opt/qnib/src/dssh
#!/bin/bash

REMOTE_HOST=$1
shift
set -x
docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock exec -i -u ${USER} ${REMOTE_HOST} $@
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$
{% endhighlight %}

Then it works again... :)

{% highlight bash %}
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$ mpirun -mca plm_rsh_agent /opt/qnib/src/dssh --allow-run-as-root -n 2 --host 2ec09afc006e /scratch/hello_mpi
+ docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock exec -i -u bob 2ec09afc006e orted --hnp-topo-sig 0N:1S:4L3:4L2:4L1:4C:4H:x86_64 -mca ess '"env"' -mca orte_ess_jobid '"3033858048"' -mca orte_ess_vpid 1 -mca orte_ess_num_procs '"2"' -mca orte_hnp_uri '"3033858048.0;tcp://172.17.0.6:60882"' --tree-spawn -mca plm_rsh_agent '"/opt/qnib/src/dssh"' -mca plm '"rsh"' --tree-spawn
Process 1 on 2ec09afc006e out of 2
Process 0 on 2ec09afc006e out of 2
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$
{% endhighlight %}

It even works with three nodes.

{% highlight bash %}
[bob@a7b1e6e98cb1 ~]$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
all*         up   infinite      3   idle 1e52c4457a18,2ec09afc006e,a7b1e6e98cb1

## Call to Arms

... rather to the keyboards...

I would like the MPI projects to implement this behaviour directly. Yes, it's not [yet] a secure path to constrain user from spawning processes in containers - but please do not bother.

Docker DC, a NGINX proxy in front of the docker-socket or something else will figure this out for us.
