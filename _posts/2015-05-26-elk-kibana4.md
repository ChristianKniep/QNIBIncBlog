Since I was ask on hub.docker.com if my [qnib/elk](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/qnib/elk/) image is going to provide kibana4 in the near future I figured it would be worth to blog about it.

The image in question is quite nice for trying the ELK stack out  and I take some pride in stating that it's the number 2 image popping up if you search for 'elasticsearch' (and rank by stars). :)

### qnib/elk (:kibana4)

For those of you who just want to play around with a ELK-stack in one image I just <s>created a kibana4-version (qnib/elk:kibana4).</s> added kibana4 into the qnib/elk image.

To start is without external images, just fetch the elk `docker-compose` file and off you go.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir -p mystack; cd mystack/
$ curl -Lso docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianKniep/docker-elk/master/docker-compose.yml
$ compose up -d
Creating mystack_elk_1...
{% endhighlight %}

Afterwards consul will provide insides on which service is up'n'running...

## Hello World

Once everything is green the world is open to be explored. :)

First a log message should be pushed, otherwise the `logstash` index won't be created and there is nothing to look at.

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo HelloWorld | nc -w1 192.168.99.100 5514 
{% endhighlight %}

Kibana3 shows up by reaching out to `:8080/kibana/`:

Kibana4 is available underneath `:5601`.

**But** (and that is why I was reluctant so far), somehow it seems to be impossible to preconfigure the settings. Maybe that had changed, but I couldn't find a file based way of doing so.<br>

Enjoy! Even though YMMV... :)
