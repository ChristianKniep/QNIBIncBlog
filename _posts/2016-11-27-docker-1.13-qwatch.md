Last week-end I was hacking on my metrics collector to be able to fetch docker-engine and docker-container stats.

But as my MeetUp in Berlin is called M.E.L.I.G. (**M**etrics,**E**vents,**L**ogs,**I**nventory and **G**lue), there is much more to it then metrics.

This week-end I hacked on a new tool: [qwatch](https://github.com/qnib/qwatch)

It is meant to be somehow qcollect for logs and events. Inspired by the input,filter and output notion of Logstash.
Even though for now I only implemented inputs and outputs.

It needs v1.25 of the docker remoteAPI and therefore docker-v1.13.

# qwatch

The following inputs are available:

- **DockerLogs** provides a gelf-endpoint (non-compressed) so that containers can send their stdin/stdout
- **DockerEvents**, which hooks into the docker events API and fetches those

Outputwise I got:

- **Log**: pushes the logs to stdout
- **Elasticsearch**, which indexes the logs to elasticsearch (kinda brittle in the first iteration)

As a good software engineer, I created (empty) test-files:

{% highlight bash %}
ok  	github.com/qnib/qcollect	0.058s           coverage: 0.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/qnib/qcollect/cmd	0.042s        coverage: 40.9% of statements
ok  	github.com/qnib/qcollect/collectors 0.022s coverage: 0.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/qnib/qcollect/output 0.010s     coverage: 0.0% of statements

ok  	github.com/qnib/qcollect/utils 0.011s      coverage: 0.0% of statements
{% endhighlight %}

At least I got the `types` already covered... Will cover more - promise!

## Spin it up

OK, despite the poor coverage... Let's see what I've done so far.

The server provides the GELF endpoint and hooks into the event-API (as said above).

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./bin/qwatch_v0.3.3_Darwin server
Using config file: /Users/kniepbert/.qnib/qwatch.yml
Start DockerLog collector listening on port 12201
{% endhighlight %}

If I start a fresh container using an image that is not already present, it goes like this.

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker run -t --rm --name hello --log-driver gelf \
             --log-opt gelf-address=udp://localhost:12201 \
             --log-opt gelf-compression-type=none \
             debian:latest echo "Hello World on '$(date)'"

{% endhighlight %}

Currently I did not implement the log-transfer as broadcast (just figured), so two outputs are competing over the logs. But let's only use the elasticsearch output:

A lot of refinement to do, but I find it thrilling. All the possibilities...
