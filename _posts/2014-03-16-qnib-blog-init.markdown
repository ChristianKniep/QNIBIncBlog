Jan-Piet Mens [blogged][jpm] about how he switched from WordPress to jekyll and since I wanted to blog
some stuff I am working on I decided to give it a spin.

This blog is going to contain nerdy stuff that crossed my mind, keyboard and installations.
My basic interest is the architecture and administration of compute cluster. 

The hot tech-topics during this spring are:

- docker
- graphite
- slurm
- statsd

Busswords:

- monitoringlove
- DevOps
