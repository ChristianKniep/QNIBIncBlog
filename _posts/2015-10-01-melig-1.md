Today was the first instance of a [M.E.L.I.G. MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/M-E-L-I-G-Berlin-Metrics-Events-Logs-Inventory-Glue/events/225176362/). The topic was about metrics in general (broad general) and what the new version of InfluxDB is going to introduce; mainly in terms of the storage backend.

We were kindly hosted by [InnoQ](https://www.innoq.com) (they have a [podcast](https://www.innoq.com/de/timeline/?type=podcast_episodes)). Thanks for that...


## M.E.L.I.G?
The MeetUp was a combination of a InfluxDB one and the first M.E.L.I.G. MeetUp.
M.E.L.I.G. is about addressing all things related to infrastructure services around:

- **M**etrics: Think graphite, InfluxDB, Cyanite, OpenTSDB and a like. Including middleware such as graphite-api, carbon-relay-ng
- **E**vents & **L**ogs where events are business related logs you do not want to miss and generic log information that might be used for debugging purposes
- **I**nventory services to get to know how the infrastructure looks like and looked like in the past
- **G**lue like Docker, heka, fluentd, runC, storage backend and so on; basically stuff that does not fit in the other parts. :)

I would like to establish a MeetUp which addresses the ever increasing stack around 
infrastructure - one aspect (use-case) at a time.

To keep things reproducible I will try to provide docker stacks for all topics covered, as to allow the attendees (and others) to recreate the experience. :)

## InfluxDB MeetUp today...

Today I introduced the meeting by showing of some (somehow random) slides around the topic 'metrics'. I promise to improve my slides next time. Time was precious this time around.
Paul Dix, the CEO of InfluxDB was kind enough to connect via Skype for insights into what the new version of InfluxDB will bring and to give an extensive Q&A.

## Metrics stack

The metrics stack I showed today can be recreated as follows. Just install `docker` and `docker-compose` and kick of the stack (OK, you need to instal `git` too).

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/ChristianKniep/orchestra.git melig1

$ cd melig1/
$ git checkout melig1 # a tag for this MeetUp, in case master does not do the trick
$ carbon-relay-ng/
$ compose pull
*snip*
$ compose up -d
Creating carbonrelayng_consul_1...
Creating carbonrelayng_carbon_1...
Creating carbonrelayng_metrics_1...
Creating carbonrelayng_gapi_1...
Creating carbonrelayng_grafana_1...
$ 
{% endhighlight %}

Open the consul WebUI by pointing our browser to the `DOCKER_HOST:8500` (e.g. [http://192.168.99.100:8500](http://192.168.99.100:8500)).
It should look somehow like this (after a moment to settle the services):

If you then hit the port `8070` you can have a look at the `carbon` backed metrics flowing in.

As a middleware relay `carbon-relay-ng` is used. It sucks in the metrics and forwards them to whatever backend is discovered by consul. For now it's only carbon.

### Add InfluxDB

By adding a second backend, carbon-relay-ng got a new configuration (provided by `consul-template`, but that's for another MeetUp) and is restarted.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd add_influxdb/
$ compose up -d
Pulling influxdb (qnib/influxdb:latest)...
latest: Pulling from qnib/influxdb
Status: Downloaded newer image for qnib/influxdb:latest
Creating addinfluxdb_influxdb_1...
$
{% endhighlight %}

![](/pics/2015-10-01/carbon-relay-ng_influxdb.png)

### Add Grafana 2.x

Since Grafana 1. didn't quite work in my setup I introduced a second version of it.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ../add_grafana2/
$ compose up -d
Pulling grafana2 (qnib/grafana2:latest)...
Status: Downloaded newer image for qnib/grafana2:latest
Creating addgrafana2_grafana2_1...
$
{% endhighlight %}

Grafana2 is accessible under `:3000` and provides a dashboard which relies on the `carbon` and the `influxdb` backend.

So long...
